## Compile & Run

### Prerequisites

You need the following libraries:
* <a href="https://www.openssl.org/source" target="_blank">OpenSSL</a> (libssl1.0-dev)
* <a href="http://curl.haxx.se" target="_blank">cURL</a> (libcurl4-openssl-dev)

C++ requires g++ version 5.3 or later.

### Get the sources

Download the source from github with:
```
git clone git://github.com/blaizard/trader.git
```

### Build

A script is available to automate the build, it will also fetch dependant git submodules.

First you need to intialize the source directory. To do so, simply run the following command from the root directory:
```
./build.sh -s
```

Then the followign will compile the source code:
```
./build.sh release
```

### Run

All binaries generated are located within the build/bin/ directory.
```
./build/bin/main
```

## Output

Trader logs various data that can be found in the output directory (by default within the build/bin/output sub-directory).
This consists of the following records:
* transactions.csv: Contains all transactions, with their timestamp, type and rates.
* profit.csv: Contains all recorded profits from the strategies in place.
* /[echanges]/: Sub-directories containing all the rate changes in CSV format for all available currency pairs for the various exchanges.

## Todo

* Block balance changes for a certain period of time to ensure fund availability for the next order (implemented/in testing)
* Disable pair if it did not get any update (or if update is invalid, rate equals 0 for example)
* Improve the unit test coverage
